# Instructions

In this exercise you'll be processing log-lines.

Each log line is a string formatted as follows: `"[<LEVEL>]: <MESSAGE>"`.

There are three different log levels:

- `INFO`
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`

You have three tasks, each of which will take a log line and ask you to do something with it.

1. Get message from a log line
   - It returns a log line's message: `<MESSAGE>`.
   - Any leading or trailing white space should be removed.
2. Get log level from a log line
   - It returns a log line's log level, which should be returned in **lowercase**.
3. Reformat a log line
